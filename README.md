# Weather Dashboard

For module six's challenge, I build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Also, per the challenge, I used OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## About Application

This is a weather dashboard with form inputs. If you use the form to search for a city, then you will be presented with the current and future conditions for that city and the city will be saved to the search history.

Within the current weather conditions for your searched city, you will be presented with the city name, the data, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index will have a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

There is also a five-day forecast for the searched city that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
